## Set up the installation files

1. Download the [latest version of osTicket](https://osticket.com/download).
2. Unzip and extract the files and upload the contents of the upload folder to a directory of your choice on your server. For example `/osticket/`, `/helpdesk/` or `/support/`.
3. If you’re using FTP to upload, make sure you know how to change file permissions (for uploading & write-access).

## Run the installation script

After uploading, you can complete the installation by:
- Visiting the folder in your browser with a osTicket URL (e.g. http://www.yourdomain.com/support).
- Or by going directly to the setup page: http://www.yourdomain.com/support/setup/

The installer will:

1. Automatically check for paths and permission issues.
2. If all checks pass, ask you to enter your configuration details (`database name/user/password`, your admin user for osTicket, etc.).
3. Create and populate the database tables.
4. Write a config file (`include/ost-config.php`).

## Set up your account

Once the installation is complete:

1. Log in with the username and password you created during the installation process.
2. Perform a cleanup:
    1. Change permission of include/ost-config.php to remove write access
    2. Delete `/setup` directory
    3. Enable the system
